Phishing URL Detector

This project presents a machine learning–based system for phishing URL detection using only URL-based features. The system classifies web links as legitimate or phishing and provides probability-based predictions in real time.

The project implements a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment. The trained model is integrated into a Flask web application with a simple user interface for URL analysis.

The dataset consists of labeled phishing and legitimate URLs obtained from a public Kaggle source. Future improvements may include additional features and more advanced models.
